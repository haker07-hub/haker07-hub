# About me


**haker07-hub/haker07-hub** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on social elites from all over the world.
- ðŸ¥° **Ask me about:** Love yourself and Embrace the whole world.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The stars may trace their distant arcs across the night,Yet the warmth of a shared glance could fold the cosmos tight.
Oceans stretch beyond horizons unseen,But a whispered 'hello' might melt the miles between.
For time bends like a river, and space is but a veilâ€”Should one choose to reach, even starlight would pale.
Not in the far-flung dawn, nor the twilight's fading hue,But here, where kindness lingersâ€”the world remakes itself anew.
